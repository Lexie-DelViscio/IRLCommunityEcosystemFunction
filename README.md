## Indian River Lagoon - Community Ecosystem Function Project
This project was conducted by Drs. Chris Freeman, Dean Janiak, and Valerie Paul with the Smithsonian Marine Station. The sampling site was located at the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) on the western coast of Florida. The project involved exposing 4 PVC panels each in 9 different sites within the IRL in order to collect suspension feeders for study on biodiversity within ecosystem function.

## The goal of this experiement was to examine the role that suspension feeder diversity plays in algal bloom interactions.  

- The project involved culturing two species of algae - Picocyano (Cyanobacteria) & Pedinophyte (Chlorophyte). Both are added to buckets of suspension feeders on panels that were collected in the field.  
-  Both algal cell species were labelled with stable isotopes C13 and N15 to detect for removal after 180 minutes time period of exposure.

- Flow cytometry data / 1 mL; counts number of cells. They can decrease exponentially but do not always. 
- Cells through time curves provides interesting information about the removal process and effectiveness.
- There were several main aspects of the study -

## Algae decay: 
    -- Hypothesis and preliminary results showing that algal cell removal is increased over time with exposure to suspension feeders, especially in exposure to those panels with the higher biodiversity/ increased diversity of community composition. 

## Diversity response:
    -- Inverse Simpson's Diversity Index calculated among panels & correlated in linear regression with algal cell removal for Pico & Pedino.
    -- Significant positive correlation (R-squared = 0.47, 0.17) in both models showing higher diversity correlated directly with more algal cell removal. 

## Community composition effects: 
    -- Community composition related in biodiversity - analyze diversity metrics among phyla/ alternate taxa in each panel and effects? 
        -- Several explanatory models could be created here with differing variables. 

## Isotopic patterns:
    -- Examining removal of algal cells over time, variance between the two algal species as well as among each panel.
