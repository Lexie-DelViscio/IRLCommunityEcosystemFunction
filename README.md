## DJM's notes from meeting with Chris, Lexie, and Franie 02-18-2022 (Please clean up and organize)
- indian river lagoon west coast of flordia
- pvc tiles
- collected suspension feeders
- different levels of coverage
- 5 months 
- 30 - 4 sp
- 100 - 9 % cover
## goal of experiement was what role does suspension feeder diversity play in algal blooms
- culture two species of algaea
- picocyano & pedinophyte
- both added to buckets of suspension feeders
- different times points
- 0 min - 180 min
- flowctyo data - 1 ml
    - counts number of cells
- cells can decrease exponentially
- but not always sometimes flat
- so cells through time curves provide interesting information
- abundance data is present on suspenstion data 

- labeled Pico with N15N
- labeled pedino with C13
