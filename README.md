## DJM's notes from meeting with Chris, Lexie, and Frannie 02-18-2022 (Please clean up and organize)

- Project site: Indian river lagoon west coast of flordia
- Exposed pvc panels covered with suspension feeders (differing levels of coverage). 
- 5 months of collection, panels ranging from 4-30 species and 9-100% cover

## goal of experiement was examining the role that suspension feeder diversity plays in algal blooms. 

- Culture two species of algae - picocyano & pedinophyte, both are added to buckets of suspension feeders
- Different times points 0 min - 180 min
- Flowcytometry data - 1 ml
    - Counts number of cells. They can decrease exponentially but do not always. 

- Cells through time curves provide interesting information
- Abundance data is present on suspenstion data 

- labeled Pico with N15 & labeled pedino with C13
