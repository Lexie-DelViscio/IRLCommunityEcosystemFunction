## Indian River Lagoon - Community Ecosystem Function Project

This project was conducted by Dr. Chris Freeman alongside several other 
scientists in the Indian River Lagoon on the western coast of Florida. The 
project involved exposing pvc panels over a 5 month time period to 9 differing 
sites within IRL in order to collect suspension feeders. Metadata will be 
provided separately for privacy purposes.


## The goal of this experiement was to examine the role that suspension feeder diversity plays in algal bloom interactions. 

- Suspension feeders were accumulated on panels in the study site. 

- Two species of algae were cultured - Picocyano (cyanobacteria) & Pedinophyte
(chlorophyte), both of which were added to buckets of suspension feeders on panels. 

-  Both algal cell species were labelled with stable isotopes C13 and N15 to 
detect for removal after 180min time period of exposure. 

- Flow cytometry data is explained by proportion of final cell counts from original / 1 mL


## Algae decay: 
    -- Hypothesis and preliminary results showing that algal cell removal is 
    increased over time with exposure to suspension feeders, especially in 
    exposure to those panels with the higher biodiversity and increased diversity 
    of community composition. 

## Diversity response:

    -- Inverse Simpson's Diversity Index calculated among panels & correlated in 
    linear regression with algal cell removal for both species of algae.
    -- Significant positive correlation (R-squared = 0.47, 0.17) in both models 
    showing higher diversity is correlated directly with more algal cell removal. 

## Community composition effects: 

    -- Community composition related in biodiversity - analyze diversity metrics 
    among phyla/ alternate taxa in each panel and effects? 
    -- Several explanatory models could be created here with differing variables. 

## Isotopic patterns:

    -- Examining removal of algal cells over time, variance between the two algal 
    species as well as among each panel. 
    -- Boxplots describing species, taxa, and site breakdown of Pedino and Pico 
    enrichment values.
    -- PCA of each algae species to determine key sites 
    
## MAIN VARIABLES   

    - Include species richness and evenness, panel diversity, and algal cell 
    removal over time. 
    
## PROJECT WORKFLOW

This project is broken down into three main pieces of analysis. 

    -- The first portion is flow cytometry analysis of algal cell removal over
    a 3 hour time period with two species of algae and all site panels in order
    to best understand which panels are most efficient at removing algal cells
    and why.
    - All analysis for flow cytometry can be found in Frannie's Scripts and
    Frannie's Graphs.

    -- The second portion of the project is an analysis of Isotopic Enrichment 
    data at the species level as well as site and taxa as well in order to gain
    knowledge of diversity function and individual portfolio effects. 

    - All of the Isotopic Analysis can be found in Lexie's Scripts and Lexie's 
    Graphs folders. 
    - It is suggested to review all of the required libraries in the 
    IRL_Isotope.Rmd and download any missing libraries prior to running the file. 
    - Specific instructions to download the PriceTools library can also be found 
    in Lexie's Scripts (pending use of it in final project, only preliminary 
    use as of yet)

    -- The third portion of this project is an analysis of the community panel 
    compositions. This can be found in Lexie's Script's. 

## Note on data:

    -- It has been requested we keep the data for this experiment confidential.

    repository owners.
    
## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

We would like to acknowledge Dr. Chris Freeman for sharing his data and project
