## DJM's notes from meeting with Chris, Lexie, and Frannie 02-18-2022 (Please clean up and organize)

- Project site: Indian river lagoon west coast of flordia
- Exposed pvc panels covered with suspension feeders (differing levels of coverage). 
- 5 months of collection, panels ranging from 4-30 species and 9-100% cover

## Goal of experiement was examining the role that suspension feeder diversity plays in algal blooms. 

- Culture two species of algae - Picocyano (cyanobacteria) & Pedinophyte (chlorophyte), both are added to buckets of suspension feeders on panels. 
-  Both algal cell species labelled with stable isotopes C13 and N15 to detect for removal after 180min time period of exposure. 
- Different times points 0 min - 180 min (Recording cell removal over the course of 3 hours)
- Flowcytometry data / 1 ml
    - Counts number of cells. They can decrease exponentially but do not always. 
- Cells through time curves provide interesting information
- Abundance data is present on suspenstion data 

## Algae decay: 
    -- Hypothesis and preliminary results showing that algal cell removal is increased over time with exposure to suspension feeders, especially 
    in exposure to those panels with the higher biodiversity/ increased diversity of community composition. 

## Diversity response:
    -- Inverse Simpson's Diversity Index calculated among panels & correlated in linear regression with algal cell removal for Pico & Pedino.
    -- Significant positive correlation (R-squared = 0.47, 0.17) in both models showing higher diversity correlated directly with more algal cell removal. 

## Community composition effects: 
    -- Community composition related in biodiversity - analyze diversity metrics among phyla/ alternate taxa in each panel and effects? 
        -- Several explanatory models could be created here with differing variables. 

## Isotopic patterns:
    -- Examining removal of algal cells over time, variance between the two algal species as well as among each panel.
