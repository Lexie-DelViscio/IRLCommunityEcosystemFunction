## Indian River Lagoon - Community Ecosystem Function Project
This project was conducted by Dr. Chris Freeman alongside several other scientists in the Indian River Lagoon on the western coast of Florida. The project involved exposing pvc panels over a 5 month time period to 9 differing sites within IRL in order to collect suspension feeders. Metadata will be provided separately for privacy purposes.

## The goal of this experiement was to examine the role that suspension feeder diversity plays in algal blooms. 

- Culture two species of algae - Picocyano (cyanobacteria) & Pedinophyte (chlorophyte), both are added to buckets of suspension feeders on panels. 
-  Both algal cell species labelled with stable isotopes C13 and N15 to detect for removal after 180min time period of exposure. 
- Record cell removal of algae 0 min - 180 min (Recording cell removal over the course of 3 hours) - This is measured in proportion of original cells to final cells.
- Flowcytometry data / 1 ml
    - Counts number of cells. They can decrease exponentially but do not always. 
- Cells through time curves provide interesting information
- Abundance data is present on suspension data 

## Algae decay: 
    -- Hypothesis and preliminary results showing that algal cell removal is increased over time with exposure to suspension feeders, especially in exposure to those panels with the higher biodiversity/ increased diversity of community composition. 

## Diversity response:
    -- Inverse Simpson's Diversity Index calculated among panels & correlated in linear regression with algal cell removal for Pico & Pedino.
    -- Significant positive correlation (R-squared = 0.47, 0.17) in both models showing higher diversity correlated directly with more algal cell removal. 

## Community composition effects: 
    -- Community composition related in biodiversity - analyze diversity metrics among phyla/ alternate taxa in each panel and effects? 
        -- Several explanatory models could be created here with differing variables. 

## Isotopic patterns:
    -- Examining removal of algal cells over time, variance between the two algal species as well as among each panel. 
    -- Boxplots describing species, taxa, and site breakdown of Pedino and Pico enrichment values.
    -- PCA of each algae species to determine key sites 
    
## MAIN VARIABLES   
    - Include species richness and evenness, panel diversity, and algal cell removal over time. 
    
## PROJECT WORKFLOW

This project is broken down into three main pieces of analysis. 

The first of which being a FLow Cytometry analysis at the site and panel level. 
FRANNIE ADD DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PIECES

The second portion of the project is an analysis of Isotopic Enrichment data at the species level as well as site and taxa as well in order to gain knowledge of diversity function and individual portfolio effects. 

-All of the Isotopic Analysis can be found in Lexie's Scripts and Lexie's Graphs folders. 
-It is suggested to review all of the required libraries in the IRL_Isotope.Rmd and download any missing libraries prior to running the file. 
-Specific instructions to download the PriceTools library can also be found in Lexie's Scripts (pending use of it in final project... only preliminary use as of yet)

The third portion of this project is an analysis of the community panel compositions. 
This analysis can be found in Lexie's scripts as well as in ...... FRANNIE wherever u have any from the original panel data if u do

## note on data
