## Indian River Lagoon - Community Ecosystem Function Project
This project was conducted by Dr. Chris Freeman alongside several other scientists in the Indian River Lagoon on the western coast of Florida. The project involved exposing pvc panels over a 5 month time period to 9 differing sites within IRL in order to collect suspension feeders. Metadata will be provided separately for privacy purposes.

## The goal of this experiement was to examine the role that suspension feeder diversity plays in algal blooms. 

- Culture two species of algae - Picocyano (cyanobacteria) & Pedinophyte (chlorophyte), both are added to buckets of suspension feeders on panels. 
-  Both algal cell species labelled with stable isotopes C13 and N15 to detect for removal after 180min time period of exposure. 
- Record cell removal of algae 0 min - 180 min (Recording cell removal over the course of 3 hours) - This is measured in proportion of original cells to final cells.
- Flowcytometry data / 1 ml
    - Counts number of cells. They can decrease exponentially but do not always. 
- Cells through time curves provide interesting information
- Abundance data is present on suspension data 

## Algae decay: 
    -- Hypothesis and preliminary results showing that algal cell removal is increased over time with exposure to suspension feeders, especially in exposure to those panels with the higher biodiversity/ increased diversity of community composition. 

## Diversity response:
    -- Inverse Simpson's Diversity Index calculated among panels & correlated in linear regression with algal cell removal for Pico & Pedino.
    -- Significant positive correlation (R-squared = 0.47, 0.17) in both models showing higher diversity correlated directly with more algal cell removal. 

## Community composition effects: 
    -- Community composition related in biodiversity - analyze diversity metrics among phyla/ alternate taxa in each panel and effects? 
        -- Several explanatory models could be created here with differing variables. 

## Isotopic patterns:
    -- Examining removal of algal cells over time, variance between the two algal species as well as among each panel. 
    
    
    
## MAIN VARIABLES   
    - Include species richness and evenness, panel diversity, and algal cell removal over time.
